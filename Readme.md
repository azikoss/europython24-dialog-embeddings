# Representation is King: The Journey to Quality Dialog Embeddings
This repo contains the code and slides for the talk ["Representation is King: The Journey to Quality Dialog Embeddings"](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/representation-is-king-the-journey-to-quality-dialog-embeddings) presented at the [EuroPython 2024](https://ep2024.europython.eu/).

## Abstract
In natural language processing, embeddings are crucial for understanding textual data. In this talk, we’ll explore sentence embeddings and their application in dialog systems. We’ll focus on a use case involving the classification of dialogs.

We’ll demonstrate the necessity of sentence transformers for this problem, specifically utilizing one of the top-performing small-sized sentence transformers. We will show how to fine-tune this model with both labeled and unlabeled dialog data, using the SentenceTransformers Python framework.

This talk is practical, packed with easy-to-follow examples, and aimed at building intuition around this topic. While some basic knowledge of Transformers would be beneficial, it is not required. Newcomers are also welcome.
